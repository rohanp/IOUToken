# What is IOUToken? 
A contract to create fungible ERC-20 tokens derived from P2P loans. Each token corresponds to a dollar of loan, its value is backed by the token-holders' belief that the loaner will pay them back, and features interest through constant-rate inflation distributed to hodlers.

### wat
IOUToken allows you to get a loan from the people you know in exchange for tokens in a cryptocurrency created by IOUToken, running on the Ethereum blockchain. Within a set amount of time, you pay back the loan (plus interest!) to the holders of the currency and then it is destroyed. So if you your friend lent you _X_ dollars, they would get _X_ tokens, and then if they needed money, they could sell the tokens to someone else. At the end of the time frame, you would pay back  

### why
The motivation here is that people you know would have a better understanding of your ability to repay than a bank—for example, if you were a college student studying CS, it is highly likely that you will be able to repay your debt post-graduation. This allows for loanworthy people who are turned down by banks to get a loan, and for others to get lower interest rates. It is similar in this sense to corporate/government bonds.

### How is IOUToken different from just getting a loan?
Tokenizing the loan provides liquidity, meaning if you lent money and got tokens, you could sell your tokens at any time.

### Will IOUToken make me rich???
Maybe. Probably not. The price of the token is capped at $1 and can only go down (because the backer will only pay back $1 for each token, and the probability that they do so is < 1), so the only money lenders can make off it is through interest and trading. 

### Why would I use IOUToken then
The same reasoon lenders give out loans. You will get a low-risk, low-return investment, with the added bonus of liquidity.

### If the currency is backed by faith in the backer, isn't it centralized just like the dollar? Why put a centralized currency on the blockchain?
Fair point. Technically, it only requires trust between the token-holders and the backer, not among the token-holders as USD does (IOUTokens can't be counterfeited). The question, however, is reflective of the centralized world we live in—at some point in future, "why not" will be a valid response.
