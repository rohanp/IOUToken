# What is IOUToken? 
A contract to create fungible ERC-20 tokens derived from P2P loans. Each token corresponds to a dollar of loan, its value is backed by the token-holders' belief that the loaner will pay them back, and features interest through constant-rate inflation distributed to hodlers.

## wat
IOUToken allows you to get a loan from the people you know in exchange for tokens in a cryptocurrency created by IOUToken, running on the Ethereum blockchain. Within a set amount of time, you pay back the loan (plus interest!) to the holders of the currency and then it is destroyed. So if you your friend lent you x dollars, they would get x tokens, and then if they needed money, they could sell the tokens to someone else. At the end of the time frame, you would pay back  

## why
The motivation here is that people you know would have a better understanding of your ability to repay than a bank——for example, if you were a college student studying CS, it is highly likely that you will be able to repay your debt post-graduation. This allows for loanworthy people who are turned down by banks to get a loan, and for others to get lower interest rates. It is similar in this sense to corporate/government bonds.

## How is IOUToken different from just getting a loan?
Tokenizing the loan provides liquidity, meaning if you lent money and got tokens, you could sell your tokens at any time.

## Will IOUToken make me rich???
Maybe. Probably not. The price of the token is capped at $1 and can only go down, so the only money lenders can make off it is through interest and trading. 

## Why would I use IOUToken then
The same reasoon lenders give out loans. You will get a low-risk, low-return investment, with the added bonus of liquidity.

## Why put a centralized currency on the blockchain?
Fair point.
